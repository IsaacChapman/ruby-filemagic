        FileMagic Library Binding

        July 28, 2003 Travis Whitton <whitton@atlantic.net>

This is one of my first ruby bindings, so suggestions are welcome. See
filemagic.rd and test.rb for usage.

to install, run these commands:

ruby extconf.rb
make
su
make install

the file(1) library and headers are required.
I have file 0.4.3.

Enjoy!
Travis
