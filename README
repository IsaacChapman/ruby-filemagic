= FileMagic Library Binding

== VERSION

This documentation refers to filemagic version 0.2.1


== DESCRIPTION

=== Revised version

September 12, 2008 Jens Wille <jens.wille@uni-koeln.de>

Similar to Ricardo[http://github.com/ricardochimal/ruby-filemagic]
I wanted this project to make some progress. My needs went a bit
farther than his, though ;-) Enjoy anyway!

Install the gem from Rubyforge[http://rubyforge.org]:

  sudo gem install ruby-filemagic

or from Github[http://github.com]:

  sudo gem install blackwinter-ruby-filemagic --source http://gems.github.com

=== Original package

July 28, 2003 Travis Whitton <tinymountain@gmail.com>

This is one of my first ruby bindings, so suggestions are welcome. See
filemagic.rd and test.rb for usage.

to install, run these commands:

  ruby extconf.rb
  make
  su
  make install

the file(1) library and headers are required.
I have file 0.4.3.

Enjoy!
Travis
